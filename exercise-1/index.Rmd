### Exercise 1 ###

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)

### Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
   ## movie: name of the movie
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # Your parameters should include a "query" and an "api_key"
   ## Note: the HTTR library will take care of spaces in the arguments
   ## Use YOUR api key.  
  
   base.url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?"
   api.key <- "a185e951c2e44bc09d35b36c918687d2"
   query.params <- list(query = movie, api_key = api.key)
  

   ## Try the interactive console:
   ## https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
   ## it will display the result in json format
   ## you can figure out how to extract the corresponding R list components
 
   ## Request data using your search query
   response <- GET(base.url, query = query.params)
   body <- content(response, "text")
   results <- fromJSON(body)
  
   ## Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
   results2 <- flatten(results$results)
   ## From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article
   ## each in their own variables
   headline <- results2$headline
   short.summary <- results2$summary_short
   link.article <- results2$link.url
   ## Return an list of the three pieces of information from above:
   ## return(list(summary, headline, link))
  return(list(short.summary, headline, link.article))
}

## get your API key.
## Mine is stored in the file "nyt_movie_reviews_api"
## you should not insert this in the code and upload to github.


### Store the name of the movie in a variable
movie <- "Almost Famous"
### Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing the movie name variable to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview(movie)

```
